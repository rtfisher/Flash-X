!! NAME
!!  sim_molVerifySolution
!!
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!  call sim_molVerifySolution(real,    intent(in)  :: t,
!!                             real,    intent(in)  :: dt,
!!                             logical, intent(out) :: valid,
!!                             real,    intent(out) :: maxError)
!!
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!    Verify the solution at the specified time.  An implementation
!!    may utilize an analytic/baseline solution or some other
!!    error-estimator to determine if the current solution is valid
!!    for the purposes of passing a unit test.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!    t        : The current time that the solution is at
!!    dt       : The current timestep
!!    valid    : Is this a valid solution
!!    maxError : The maximum error present in the solution that was utilized
!!               to determine if the solution was valid
!!
