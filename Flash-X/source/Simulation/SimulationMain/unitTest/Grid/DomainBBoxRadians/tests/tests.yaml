###### Motivation
## This test was designed largely to check whether angle coordinates
## are consistently converted from degrees (in Grid-owned runtime
## parameters) to radians (Flash-X code internal convention). All Grid
## implementations should have consistent behavior in this
## respect. Some other Grid features are also tested along the way,
## mostly those that apply to all, or nearly all, Grid
## implementations.
##
## While blocks are typically specified in Flash-X to have the same
## number of cells along each direction, the Grid unit does not insist
## that all blocks must be specified this way.  Therefore, this test
## was explicitly written to confirm correct functionality when using
## blocks with a different number of cells along different directions.
##
###### Success vs. Failure
## As this test is a unit test it indicates via the Flash-X-standard
## `unitTest_0000` file if all tests passed or if any test failed.
## Note that some expected values used to assess correctness are
## hardcoded in the code.  As a result, the test can only be
## configured in specific ways via the par files and the setup command
## (See the specifications below).  It is unlikely that this test will
## function correctly if more than one MPI process is used.
##
###### Status
## These tests have been verified to function correctly on
## GCE/compute-02 with GFortran / GCC 7.5.0 compilers and can
## therefore be included in testsuites.
