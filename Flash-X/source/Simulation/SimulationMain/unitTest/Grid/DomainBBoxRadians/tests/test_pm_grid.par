##### TRICKS
# Settings to avoid warnings (or even program aborts) about
# non-positive values for variables that are usually taken as mass
# density and specific energies, and are thus handled specially by the
# Grid unit.  This may only be necessary for the Paramesh Grid, since
# its gr_sanitizeDataAfterInterp subroutine appears to be particularly
# picky by default.
# Negative values for "small rho" and "small energy" bounds should not
# be used in physically meaningful simulations! The values here are
# chosen to be just low enough (and then some) to avoid warnings in
# the default test configuration with NGUARD=2.
